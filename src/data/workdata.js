    brief:
      "Collaborating with the design team at Brigade, I played a key role in crafting the brand identity for Jimdo's video explainer series. Our journey involved navigating various iterations, delving into illustration, character design, and 3D graphics, ultimately converging on a sleek and minimal direction for the series.\n\nWorking closely with the creative director, I contributed to the conceptualization and rendering of storyboard frames. Once approved, we meticulously translated these frames into reality using Illustrator and After Effects, bringing the series to life through animation in After Effects.\n\nA defining aspect of our creative process was the establishment of a visual framework centered around a responsive grid. This innovative approach dictated that each element within the series had to dynamically grow and shrink in harmony with its surrounding elements. Given the complexity of our frames, utilizing a third-party plugin for responsive grids proved impractical. Consequently, every intricate timing detail was meticulously animated by hand in After Effects, underscoring our commitment to precision and the seamless integration of design elements.",

    brief:
      "Engaging in an extensive five-month freelance collaboration with Belljar Animation Studio, I played a pivotal role in crafting a ten-episode series for Ripple Labs. The series aimed to demystify the intricacies of their blockchain technology, The XRP Ledger, elucidating its unique features and differentiators in the realm of blockchain.\n\nCommencing this endeavor early in the production phase, I embarked on the journey from sketching storyboards on paper to the meticulous design process in Illustrator. Numerous weeks were dedicated to client revisions, culminating in collaborative efforts with Ripple's design team through Figma. The overarching objective was to distill complex concepts into concise, visually appealing episodes that would distinguish themselves within the established visual language of blockchain technology.\n\nNavigating the challenge of standing out amidst a well-established library of blockchain visualizations, we created a cohesive visual language by establishing a dictionary of icons, symbols, and colors. This ensured consistency and clarity across all ten episodes, with each frame and project file meticulously built using elements from the master key, placing organizational efficiency at the forefront of this intricate project.\n\nThis project marked one of my initial forays into freelance work after graduating in the spring of 2021. Beyond its technical complexities, it served as an invaluable learning experience, imparting lessons in project organization within diverse time zones, effective communication with clients and designers, and the adaptation of design and animation styles previously unexplored in my career.",

Leveraging these elements, I embarked on designing storyboards for a typography-based trailerâ€”a creative endeavor aimed at both explaining and enticing viewers to tune in.\n\nThe narration for the trailer, delivered by the podcast host, Adam Richman, exuded a punchy and exciting energy. To align with this dynamic voiceover, the design and animation of the trailer demanded a corresponding vibrancy. Collaborating with the promotional team, I ensured that the visual elements not only complemented but also enhanced the lively and engaging tone of the narration.\n\nThis project not only involved the meticulous application of a provided style guide but also required a keen understanding of storytelling through typography and animation.

After selecting their answers, users could assess their responses and opt to generate a new set of 5 trivia questions. This challenge proved to be both rewarding and occasionally demanding, pushing the boundaries of my React skills.\n\nThe heart of the challenge lay in navigating the intricacies of working with an API and implementing functions to compare user input data with information retrieved from the API. This experience provided invaluable insights into API interactions and elevated my proficiency in handling more complex coding functions within React.\n\nAdding an extra layer of complexity, I deviated from the recommended API link that solely presented general knowledge questions of medium difficulty. Instead, I harnessed the API's versatility, allowing users to select from a vast array of trivia categories, each with varying difficulty levels. This not only posed an additional coding challenge for me but also enriched the trivia experience for users.\n\nLooking ahead, I plan to elevate the web design of this app in 2024. As one of the first fully-fledged apps I both designed and coded, it marks a pivotal point in my journey, and I am eager to enhance its visual appeal and user interface.",
